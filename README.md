# Car-recognition-AI

I made this AI to understand the basics of image classification with AI. 
The AI detect all cars in an picture and draw a box around it, like in the picture below. 
It also works with video, but there is a small delay because of the model calculations. 
You can try it out yourself by cloning the project and installing the requirements. 

I hope you enjoy it!
